# omoshola.me

Personal site of Omoshola Owolabi — AI researcher and engineer working on financial risk intelligence, explainable AI, and agentic systems infrastructure.

Built with [Astro 5](https://astro.build), [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com), TypeScript, and MDX. Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The dev server (`npm run dev`) works for most changes. For full search and pagefind support, use `npm run build` + `npm run preview`.
