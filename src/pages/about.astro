          AI researcher and engineer. I build systems that are trustworthy not just when they are
          deployed, but over time — in regulated financial environments, critical supply chains,
          and the infrastructure that moves money between people.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">The technical side</h2>

      <p>
        I build explainable AI systems — not explainable as a feature bolted on at the end,
        but as a design constraint that shapes every decision from feature engineering to model
        selection to how the audit trail gets generated. In practice that means credit risk
        models that produce adverse action reasons satisfying ECOA and FCRA. Supply chain risk
        intelligence that a procurement officer can interrogate rather than just trust.
        Probabilistic planning engines that show their uncertainty instead of hiding it inside
        a point estimate.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work across the full stack — from the mathematics of fairness constraints and
        uncertainty propagation, to the engineering of production inference pipelines, to the
        regulatory interpretation of what "explainability" actually requires in a given
        jurisdiction. The research and the implementation inform each other. You cannot do
        one well without doing the other.
      </p>

      <p>
        My published research has accumulated over 100 citations, covering ethical frameworks
        for AI in financial decision-making, machine learning for credit risk prediction,
        blockchain in supply chain finance, and network analysis for systemic risk assessment.
        I contribute to IEEE international standards development across AI ethics, cybersecurity,
        financial LLM requirements, and supply chain security.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">The non-technical side</h2>

      <p>
        I grew up in Nigeria. My path into this field came through trade finance and supply
        chain operations, not through a straight line from school to research. I spent years
        working inside the systems that AI is now trying to improve before I started building
        the AI. That gave me something a purely academic route would not have: I understand
        what it feels like to be on the receiving end of a bad model's output.
      </p>

      <p>
        That background shapes everything. When I write about algorithmic bias in credit
        scoring, I am not writing abstractly. I have seen what it means for communities where
        the formal financial system has historically not worked for them. The governance
        questions are personal before they are professional.
      </p>

      <p>
        I review research, judge hackathons and statistics competitions, mentor practitioners
        earlier in their careers, and have submitted technical commentary to federal AI policy
        processes — because the people who build these systems should be in the room where
        they get governed, not watching from outside.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside the work I think seriously about African knowledge systems and what they have
        to teach us about computation and intelligence. The connection between Ifa divination's
        binary structure and the mathematical foundations of computing is not a metaphor. It is
        history that most people in this field have simply never encountered.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">What I am building</h2>

      <p>
        Everything I am building points at the same question: what does it actually take for
        an AI system to be trustworthy over time — not just at launch, but as the world changes
        around it, as decisions accumulate, as edge cases surface, as regulators ask questions?
        That question has two parts: the domain systems that need to be trustworthy, and the
        agent infrastructure that makes them run.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Nexus</strong> is a supply chain intelligence platform built in Rust. It treats
        demand, lead times, and supplier reliability as probability distributions rather than
        point estimates, runs Monte Carlo simulation across thousands of scenarios, and uses an
        agentic layer to surface recommendations that a procurement team can audit. The full
        42-layer architecture is implemented — temporal graph kernel, BOM/MRP/procurement
        modules, GraphQL API with over 70 queries, and a React interface. The hard problem in
        supply chain planning is not the algorithm. It is making the algorithm's reasoning
        visible enough that a human expert will act on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>FyxCred</strong> is a credit intelligence platform built around behavioral
        cashflow data rather than traditional bureau scores. It produces three scores —
        financial health, income stability, and financial resilience — from bank transaction
        history, using a consent-first data layer and a bias transparency framework that can
        explain every score in plain terms. The specification is locked and the build is starting.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Cortex</strong> and <strong>AgenticMemory</strong> are the infrastructure layer
        that agents themselves need. Cortex is a web cartography system — it maps entire sites
        into navigable binary graphs and gives agents the structure to move through documentation
        the way a researcher would, not the way a script does. It ships with a query language,
        framework integrations for LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, and an MCP server.
        AgenticMemory is a persistent memory substrate: a binary graph format that stores
        facts, decisions, corrections, and reasoning chains with semantic edge types, so an
        agent can reconstruct what it knew, when it learned it, and what caused it to change
        its mind. It is in active release — over 440 tests passing, dual Python and Rust
        distributions, and a peer-reviewed research paper. Both have posts here.
      </p>

      <p>
        The thread connecting all of it: agents operating in financial and regulated environments
        cannot just be capable. They need to be auditable, correctable, and honest about what
        they do not know.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Get in touch</h2>

      <p>
        I am open to speaking engagements, research collaborations, peer review, and
        advisory conversations — particularly around AI governance, explainable AI for
        financial services, agentic systems infrastructure, and supply chain risk intelligence.
